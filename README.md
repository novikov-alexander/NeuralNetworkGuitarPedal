- To play with an interactive web version of this, check out: https://www.tomlum.com/deepwavebend

- To train your own version of this model on google colab, check out https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1R8RkEpCx-nF14CDtBC31VDjcdb9Jfvfq


- To run this model on your desktop, you'll need to have python and pipenv and then run
  - `pipenv install`
  - `pipenv run python run.py saves/guitar2piano.h5`

**NOTE: This network was trained on my guitar and setup, so your mileage with your guitar and setup may vary**

(My apologies if you run into issues with this, python package management is an absolute nightmare and a half.)
